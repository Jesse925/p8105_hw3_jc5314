# Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

**“write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and
structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving
illstrative examples of observations.”**

The dataset contains 1384617 observations and 15 variables.

  - There are 134 aisles in total here, and the aisles that the most
    items ordered from is ‘fresh vegetables’.

  - A plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered：

<!-- end list -->

``` r
aisle_plot = 
  instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, name = 'number_of_items_ordered') %>%
  filter(number_of_items_ordered > 10000) %>%
  arrange(number_of_items_ordered) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = number_of_items_ordered, y = aisle)) + 
    geom_point() +
    xlab('Number of items ordered') +
    ylab('Aisle name') +
    labs(title = 'Number of items ordered in each aisle with more than 10000 items ordered')
  
# show the plot

aisle_plot
```

  - A table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
    `baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables
    fruits` (numbers of times each item is ordered are also included):

<!-- end list -->

``` r
pop_item = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(
    aisle %in% c('baking ingredients', 'dog food care', 'packaged vegetables fruits')
  ) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name, name = 'number_of_ordered_time') %>% 
  top_n(n = 5, wt = number_of_ordered_time) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c('Aisle name', 'Top 5 popular items on this aisle', 'Number of ordered time'),
               caption = 'Table 1: The 3 most popular items in the aisles and their numbers of time being ordered.')

Table 1: The 3 most popular items in the aisles and their numbers of
time being ordered.

  - A table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
    and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
table_p1 = 
  instacart %>% 
    filter(
    product_name %in% c('Pink Lady Apples', 'Coffee Ice Cream')
  ) %>% 
  group_by(order_dow) %>% 
  mutate(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  select(product_name, order_dow, mean_hour) %>% 
  arrange(order_dow) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour,
    values_fn = list(mean_hour = mean)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c('Product Name', 'Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'),
               caption = 'Table 2: Mean hour of the day at which the product was ordered on each day of the week.')
